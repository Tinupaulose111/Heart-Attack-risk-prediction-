Built a classification model to predict heart attack risk using clinical and lifestyle data.

Performed data preprocessing and validation, including outlier treatment, missing value handling, and transformation.

Applied feature engineering and selection (VIF, statistical OLS) to identify the most significant health predictors.

Addressed imbalanced data using SMOTE and oversampling techniques, ensuring balanced model performance.

Implemented an end-to-end ML pipeline covering preprocessing, training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation.

Evaluated performance using ROC/AUC, Precision-Recall, F-beta Score, and Cohenâ€™s Kappa to ensure robustness.

Applied SHAP analysis for model interpretability, enabling insights into key factors influencing heart attack risk.

Tools & Libraries: Python (Scikit-learn, Imbalanced-learn, Pandas, NumPy, Statsmodels, SHAP), Jupyter Notebook
